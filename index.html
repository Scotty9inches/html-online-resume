    <h2>SummaryüñäÔ∏è</h2>
    <p>
      I want to be a web developer. I may not have a lot of expirience but I
      know how to work hard.<br />
      I believe you can learn anything by yourself and solve any problem no
      matter how hard it could be

    <h2>Educationüìö</h2>
    <p>
      I have finished FEFU university with the degree in Fundametal and Applied
      Linguistics. The degree involved integration of linguistics in computer
      technologies, very similar to computational linguistics. Example of
      projects would be: text generation, speech analysis, creation of models
      based on texts.
